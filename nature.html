        <p> Major part of the country are horizonless steppes, deserts and mountains that house thousands species of animals and birds.</p>
        <p>Kazakhstan is the largest country in the world which has no access to the World Ocean; however the territory of Kazakhstan is washed by land-locked seas: the Caspian and Aral ones. The nature of Kazakhstan is beautiful in its own way. It is severe, since the majority of the territory consists of deserts 164,000,000 ha (44%) and semi-deserts (14%). Only 26% of the territory is occupied by steppe zones and 5,5% (21,000,000 ha) by forest ones. There is Sary-Arka – a “yellow steppe” in the central part of the country and the Turgai plateau to the west from it. The territory of Kazakhstan is so vast that it occupies the Urals in the West and the Altai and Tarbagatai in the East. The Ustyurt plateau and the Caspian sea coast are located in the South-West. The eastern part of Kazakhstan reaches the northern Tien-Shan.</p>

        <p>The climate of the republic is mainly sharply continental. The temperature in summer rises to +49° in the South and in winter may fall to -57° in the North. At the same time the weather in a desert is changeable and unsteady, hot in the daytime and at night, northern winds are blowing, bringing the cold.</p>
        <p>As far as the countries’ water resource concerns, though the major part of Kazakhstan is deserts, it has 8,500 small and large rivers. The largest ones from them are the Ural, Emba, Syrdarya, Ishim, Ili, Irtysh and Tobol. One of the largest lakes in Kazakhstan is Lake Balkhash. Up to date, Kazakhstan has been paying great attention to conservation of ecosystem, flora and fauna of the Aral Sea, a part of which is located in the territory of the country. Kazakhstan as well owns the whole northern and part of the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea – that is almost 2340 km.</p>
